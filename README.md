# Tinder-using-Tkinter
Here I have designed a GUI based Tinder application using Python and Tkinter. The application will firstly connect to the data base and then it will check for the Login credentials. All the data that is entered in the application will be stored in the MySQL database. It is a replica of the original Tinder application using the Python GUI and Tkinter.
